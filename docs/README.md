## Quick Examples

### Integration in Vue Project

The following example shows how to quickly integrate WebCut in a Vue project:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Import core components and styles
import { WebCutEditor } from 'webcut';
import 'webcut/esm/style.css';

// Project ID (example)
const yourProjectId = 'example-project';
</script>

<template>
  <div class="editor-container">
    <h1>Video Editor</h1>
    <!-- Use the complete editor component directly -->
    <WebCutEditor :project-id="yourProjectId" />
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.editor-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
</style>
```

> **Tip**: The above code will render a complete video editing interface, including video canvas, toolbar and timeline. You can also import components and tools from `webcut` as needed for customization.
